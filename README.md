# Attendance App

I have developed a MERN stack app for this task. You can find intructions for running webapp locally below, and even how to use it.

I tried to host the website on AWS EC2 instance [http://51.20.7.73:5000/](http://51.20.7.73:5000/). But I don't know why the browser is redirecting all HTTP requests into HTTPS requests and because of this the UI is not able to make POST requests (however they are wokring when I tried them in postman) because of this automatic conversion form HTTP to HTTPS i am getting `net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR`. I don't know why even after specially mentioning HTTP in url of fetch request it is requesting to HTTPS but only because of this the above link might render frontend, but it is not able to make POST requests. Steps to run it locally are given below.

I have used JSON web token to authenticate admin using authtoken stored in localStorage, so that they don't have to login repeteadly. The database used to store student details is MongoDB.

Moreover for showing notifications in the webapp I have a used the [NotificationJS](https://shlok-jain.github.io/Notification-library/) library (which is created by me, you can have a look at it ðŸ˜Ž). (PS: if the webcam pages stop working at some point, please reload the page)

### Intructions to run the code locally:
1. Clone the repository using
```console
git clone https://github.com/Shlok-Jain/pclub_task6
```
2. cd in the repository
```console
cd ./pclub_task6
```
3. cd in backend
```console
cd ./backend
```
4. Install libraries
```console
npm install
```
5. Run backend (make sure localhost port 5000 is free)
```console
node index.js
```
6. Open a new terminal for frontend and cd in frontend folder
```console
cd ./pclub_task6/vite-project
```
7. Install libraries
```console
npm install
```
8. Run frontend
```console
npm run dev
```
9. Go to link mentioned in terminal to access webapp.

### How to use
- Go to student login page, enter roll no and password to get your attendance
- To add new student: Login on admin login page(password: admin123) then click "Add student". Allow camera access, enter details, click photo using "Take photo" button, and submit. (It may take 30-40s, the reason for these long delays is that I am getting error while installing tensorflow/tfjs-node in npm)
- Mark attendance: login in admin panel, click on "Mark attendance", click "take photo" and submit (it may take 30-40s)


### Frontend endpoints:
- `/` : Home page
- `/student` : For students to see their attendance history
- `/admin` : For admin login
- `/adminpanel` : To see all students' attendance history
- `/addstudent` : Registering new students
- `/mark` : Marking attendance (it will take some time, please be patient...)

### Backend endpoints:
- `/student(POST)` : returns attendance history by taking roll no. and password of specific student.
- `/addstudent(POST)` : Registeres a student in database.
- `/adminlogin(POST)` : Admin authentication (password: admin123)
- `/getstudentsattendance(POST)` : returns attendance history of all students
- `/markattendance(POST)` : Marks attendance of student, taking this photo
